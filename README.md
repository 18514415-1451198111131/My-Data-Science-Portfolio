## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Breakdown

### 1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML forms the **structural backbone** of the website. It is used to lay out all content elements, including:
- Semantic sections (`<section>`, `<nav>`, `<header>`, etc.)
- Anchors and links to jump between sections
- A dynamic **hamburger menu** for mobile responsiveness
- An interactive **contact form** using `<form>` with fields for name, email, and message
- Downloadable CV link and project descriptions

### 2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS was used to **style and theme** the site consistently using a custom color palette:
- **Petronas Green** (`#00A19B`) and **Dark Grey** (`#788084`) were used to create a professional and modern visual identity.
- Buttons were made rounded and smooth with shadows for depth.
- Responsive layout using media queries to ensure mobile-friendliness.
- A full-screen **animated background image** was applied to give the site a lively appearance.
- Profile and contact icons were styled to maintain aesthetic harmony.

### 3. JavaScript

JavaScript was used to inject **interactivity and animations**, including:
- **Hamburger Menu Toggle**: Users can open and close the menu on smaller screens.
- **Scroll Animations**: Sections fade and slide into view as the user scrolls, adding motion and engagement.
- **Responsive menu behavior**: Ensures that the navigation is accessible and intuitive on all devices.
